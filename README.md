My apologies, you are absolutely right. The previous response did not use the markdown syntax itself, it only described it. I will now provide the text in the correct Markdown format, so you can copy and paste it directly into a README.md file for a professional-looking GitHub repository.

QuickBites: A Predictive Food Delivery ETA Engine
Live Demo: https://quickbites.streamlit.app/

QuickBites is an advanced food delivery time predictor for Bengaluru. This project moves beyond simple estimates by building a machine learning model that provides a holistic "click-to-door" time.

It achieves this by integrating a traffic-forecasted travel time from the Google Maps API with other critical operational factors like restaurant preparation time, location-specific delays, and time of day. The result is a dynamic, end-to-end prediction engine deployed as a fully interactive Streamlit web application.

‚ú® Features
Predictive Traffic Forecasting: Utilizes the Google Maps Directions API to get a travel time estimate based on Google's historical traffic data for a future departure time.

Advanced ML Model: A Random Forest Regressor that learns the "Operational Friction"‚Äîhidden delays in the kitchen and at the customer's doorstep‚Äîon top of the API's travel forecast.

Interactive UI: A polished Streamlit web app for a seamless user experience.

Dynamic Map Visualization: An interactive Folium map that displays the optimal delivery route.

Detailed ETA Breakdown: Transparently shows the user the breakdown of the total time (Food Prep vs. Travel Time).

Dynamic Fee Calculation: Estimates the delivery fee with a simple surge pricing model for peak hours.

Secure API Key Management: Uses .env files for secure and easy local development and Streamlit Secrets for deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/balanivansh/L2-project-QuickBites.git
cd L2-project-QuickBites
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Create a requirements.txt File
Create a file named requirements.txt in your project folder and paste the following content into it:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
streamlit
requests
joblib
python-dotenv
folium
streamlit-folium
polyline
4. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Set Your Google Maps API Key (Local Setup)
Obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console. Make sure to enable both the Geocoding API and the Directions API. Create a file named .env in your project root folder. Add your API key to the .env file like this (do not use quotes):

GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
6. Run the Full Pipeline
The scripts must be run in order. Note that 02_train_and_save_model.py makes many API calls and may take several minutes to complete.

Bash

# Step 1: Geocode the location data
python 01_acquire_and_geocode_data.py

# Step 2: Generate data and train the model
python 02_train_and_save_model.py
7. Launch the Streamlit App
Bash

streamlit run 03_app.py
Your browser should automatically open with the QuickBites app running locally.

ü§ñ Model Details
Input Features: Restaurant Name, Customer Location, Restaurant Type, Prep Time, Order Hour, Day of the Week, Road Distance (km), and Traffic-Forecasted Travel Time (min).

Output: Total Estimated Delivery Time (minutes).

Model: Random Forest Regressor with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

üìÅ Code Structure
01_acquire_and_geocode_data.py: Gathers and geocodes the base restaurant and customer location data.

02_train_and_save_model.py: Generates a realistic training dataset using traffic forecasts and then trains, evaluates, and saves the final ML model.

03_app.py: The main Streamlit application that loads the model and provides the interactive UI.

üöÄ Deployment
This app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. For deployment, the Maps_API_KEY is not stored in the .env file but is set securely in the app's Secrets settings on the Streamlit dashboard.
